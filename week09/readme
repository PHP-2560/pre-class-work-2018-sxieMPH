    Extract all of the sector names from the “Stock Sectors” table (bottom left of the web page.)
    Extract all of the “3 Month % Change” values from the “Stock Sectors” table.
    Extract the table “What’s Moving” (top middle of the web page) into a data-frame.

    Extract the titles under the “Latest News” section (bottom middle of the web page.)
    To understand the structure of the data in a web page, it is often useful to know what the underlying attributes are of the text you see. Extract the attributes (and their values) of the HTML element that holds the timestamp underneath the “What’s Moving” table.
